Hi! there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hana. I'm so glad you are here. :relaxed:

I was dreaming about Front-end developer using web.
But now I'm learning how to analyze Bigdata using R and how to develop software using C# and Python.

I still love making website using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
But I also like what i learn now. It so fun! :star_struck:

Now I'm dreaming about me, be a software developer.
I hope working what i love. :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
So I'll try every time to reaching what i hope.

I enjoy solving the puzzle, listening the rockNroll and jazz, and riding a bicycle.
